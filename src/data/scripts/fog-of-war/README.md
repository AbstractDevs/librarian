Fog of War is designed to make both good and evil question who is really on their team, if their ability is working properly, or what the heck is even happening. While the original goal was to make lots of folks drunk or poisoned, the hope now is to have both teams a bit more cagey in how they approach the game as enemies could be coming from any direction.

Some key characters are Magician (disrupt the evil team), Acrobat (potentially confirm drunk/poison), Goon (disrupt everyone), and Chambermaid (confirm night situations).
