## Intro

Welcome to Season 1 of the Abstract Games legacy clocktower! The rules are generally built around the [Flesh and Bone Ruleset](https://fleshandbone.app/index.php#rules) with a fuew small modifications. A quick summary is as follows:

1. Each character that **dies by execution** is removed from the script. 
2. At the end of the game, all players who had there characters removed chose a new character of the same role to replace their old character.

## Current Score: Evil 1 : Good 0

This section is mostly because I haven't yet determined the end of the legacy season, and one of the options in Flesh and Bone is "first team to X wins".
