A concept where each player chooses which character they are out of **all
possible characters in Blood on the Clocktower**. The following caveats apply,
also listed in the Bootlegger's description:

- On the 1st night, all players choose a character (of their assigned character
  type) to become
- The Atheist, Engineer & Pit-Hag are banned
- The Drunk, Lunatic and Marionette cannot be chosen
- Only a Demon may choose to become the Summoner. If so, the summoned player
  chooses which Demon they become
- If there is more than 1 of the same character, 1 or more of the extras might
  be drunk
- The only character with a setup effect that applies is the Bounty Hunter

## How to run

1. During setup pass out as many "Choose a [team]" tokens to satisfy the player count requirements
2. On the first night, ask each player to choose a character of their given
   character type (this is easiest to do with the "Make a choice" night card)
3. Change each character token to the chosen character, adhering to the above rules
