# Demon Hunting

Welcome to Demon Hunting, a Blood on the Clocktower script revolving around super powered town roles and hiding demons!

---

### Townsfolk

- Starting Info: **Clockmaker, Investigator, Grandmother, Bounty Hunter**
  - These are the building blocks for town. They allow town to confirm one another and begin their hunt to find the evil team.
- Once per game: **Slayer, Professor**
  - These roles give town a powerful comeback mechanic in the Slayer while the Professor can revive a helpful townsfolk who may have perished too early.
- If the demon kills: **Banshee, Choirboy**
  - Banshee here is a confirmed good role that can help balance out the added evil players.
  - Choirboy is pretty self explanatory, by no means should you feel obligated to include one if the King is in the bag.
- Each night: **King, Dreamer, Cannibal, General, Sailor**
  - These roles are town's best bet to finding the demon.
  - They allow town to more easily find the demon, get one last use out of an executed player's role, or check if they're on the right path.
  - Sailor is a double edged sword. While it can protect powerful townsfolk at the cost of drunking them, it also paints a target on your back for being executed.

### Fabled

- This fabled will only allow one extra player to turn evil. This gives town the ability to bluff who's evil in an attempt to confuse the evil team while not making the game too imbalanced for evil.

### Outsiders

- **Ogre, Goon, Puzzlemaster, Klutz**
  - While Ogre and Goon both fulfill very similar roles here, Goon exists to give evil a reason to avoid hitting them on accident.
  - Puzzlemaster exists to give the evil team a way to discredit town info as being "drunk" and gives good another way to find the demon.
  - Klutz acts as another hidden outsider that comes with a deadly secret if killed.

### Minions

- Outsider mod minions: **Xaan, Godfather**
  - Xaan obscures both player information and outsider count. A very powerful way for evil to build worlds to contradict town.
  - Godfather allows evil to quicken the pace of the game and gives outsiders more of a reason to hide, even if they're the Ogre or Goon.
- Utility minions: **Boffin, Wizard**
  - These minions offer the evil team a lot of utility and creativity in how they can evade town's grasps.
  - Boffin virtually gives the evil team another bluff as well as another venue to spread misinformation.
  - Wizard gets to do whatever it wants :D

### Demons

- Jumping demons: **Fang Gu, Lil' Monsta, Imp**
  - It would be too easy for town if the demon stayed in one spot wouldn't it? Both demons can rotate across the grim in an attempt to evade the good team.
- Undying demon: **Lleech**
  - Lleech gives evil another source of poisoning and helps evade the good team by refusing to die even if found.

I hope this lil' write up gives you a general idea of how I designed the script but is by no means the only way to run it. Happy hunting!
