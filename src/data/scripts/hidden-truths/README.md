Hidden Truths is a script based on the fundamental idea that everything that happens can be explained in tons of ways. Did the Chef get a 4 because it's a Legion game, or is the Vortox causing incorrect information? Did the Acrobat choose a drunk player, or did an Assassin cause the extra kill at night? Is it an Atheist game, or is all the weird stuff happening because of a Widow pulling the strings?

## Good Team Suggestions

- Does it seem like there are too few people on the good team? Maybe it's a Legion game.
- Does all the information seem wrong? Maybe it's a Vortox game.
- Is anything that's happening nonsensical by your understanding of the game? Maybe it's an Atheist game.
- Does you ability not seem to work correctly? Could you be drunk/poisoned, or are you actually the Marionette?
- Do you think you're the Atheist? Be _very_ careful about this, because you might be the Drunk!

## Evil Team Suggestions

- As a Minion, you are the only role type in the game to be completely confident in your identity. Use that to your advantage.
- As a Demon, make it a priority to determine whether or not you are actually the Lunatic. You want to make sure you're helping the right team!
- Are you Legion? Don't let _anyone_ on the good team know this, and do your absolute best to throw suspicion onto the members of the good team. Once the good team can figure out it's a Legion game with certainty, good is very likely to win.
- Steer people off the trail! The best thing for the good team to do is to figure out which Demon (or lack of Demon) is in play, so make sure to get them to believe something different.

## Storyteller Suggestions

- When running an Atheist game, be careful not to make it impossible for the good team to figure it out. You don't want to make it too easy and lead to an uninteresting game, and it's fine if the good team loses an Atheist game on rare occasions, but it can be dissatisfying for the good team to all lose because you didn't give them enough information. Try to leave hints about things that are strange!
- When running a Legion game, you should almost never choose for a good team member to die at night. It is up to Legion to convince the good team to execute themselves, and that's their primary goal. Occasionally feel free to choose not to cause a death at night if you want to fake an Innkeeper protection or a sunk kill, or potentially very rarely allow a good team night death if you made the good team larger than usual, but these choices should be exceptions to the rule.
- Make sure not to fall into too much of a meta. Of course, most of the time, it's weird to have a Slayer in a Legion game, or an Acrobat in a game with no drunkenness or poisoning, so you don't want to do that very often. But break that assumption occasionally! You don't want any character to be completely confident in a reality just because of their existence in the game.
