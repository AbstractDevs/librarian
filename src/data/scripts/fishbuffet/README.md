A concept where each player chooses which character they are out of **all
base script characters in Blood on the Clocktower**. The following caveats apply,
also listed in the Bootlegger's description:

- On the 1st night, all players choose a character (of their assigned character
  type) to become

* The Pit-Hag is banned

- The Drunk and Lunatic cannot be chosen

- If there is more than 1 of the same character, 1 or more of the extras might
  be drunk

- No characters' setup abilities apply

## How to run

1. During setup pass out as many "Choose a [team]" tokens to satisfy the player count requirements
2. On the first night, ask each player to choose a character of their given
   character type (this is easiest to do with the "Make a choice" night card)
3. Change each character token to the chosen character, adhering to the above rules
